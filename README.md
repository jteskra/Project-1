# Project-1
Project 1 for Ku Bootcamp Course
Our Project was to find out which automobile stock was the best to invest in since Janurary 2, 2020. We choose 6 car companies to analysize: Ford, GM, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, and Honda. We then compared these companies to the S&P 500. We used the S&P 500 as a benchmark to measure against. Trading volume, percent stock change, p/e ratio, and daily percent change were the four ways we measured each stocks success. We wanted to answer these four questions:
Has the automobile industry outperformed the S&P 500?
Which automobile stock is the best?
Should you move your stock from the S&P 500 to the automobile industry?
Which country has created the best automobile company company to invest in?

Our conclution was that Germany has made the best car companies to invest in, with BMW being our top earner, moving up almost 45% since 2020. 

Ian made a couple line graphs to represent the percent daily change for the entire automoile indurty vs S&P 500 and a line graph with each individual stock plotted against the S&P 500.

Josh made all the vizualizations for the second question, and the bar graph in the first question.

Sabar made the box plot and the bar graph that answers the fourth question.

We got our data from https://www.nasdaq.com/ and downloaded their 5 year chart for each stock, then parsed out the dates that we needed. We used combined_df for all of us to build off
